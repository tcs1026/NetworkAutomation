# NetworkAutomation
Terry is taking Ivan P's Network Automation course.
A very interesting course. I'm learning a bunch of stuff that I would like to know. Some, like Git, are new systems that perform functions like version control that I used to do with other tools (rcs/cvs).

The lab is done in GNS3. Three simple routers on a single switch-based LAN. The MacBookPro is connected via the cloud to the routers. Very simple. It will need some more complexity to do some of the later labs where control functions need to be performed.
Files: lab.png is a screenshot of the lab configuration. Note the interface names.

Preparation for Nick Russo's automation and CI/CD course.
